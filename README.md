## Mission and Purpose:

StuyPulse Robotics is a student-led club committed to fostering enthusiasm for robotics and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects by cultivating collaboration among students, parents, mentors, and sponsors. Our primary objectives include:

1. Enhancing robotics and STEM awareness within our community,
2. Encouraging education and skill development in various fields such as engineering, computer science, web design, 3D animation, business, fundraising, and marketing.

To achieve these goals, the club actively participates in various robotics competitions, including those organized by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a renowned international robotics organization.

## Description:

The Stuyvesant Robotics Team is a comprehensive organization dedicated to the practical application of science, technology, and business in the field of robotics. Our primary focus is on participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) by undergoing an intensive, yet enjoyable, six-week build season to create a competitive robot. The team is divided into multiple specialized departments, each contributing to the overall success of the team:

1. Engineering Department: Responsible for designing and constructing the hardware of the robot, including mechanical components, electronic systems, and pneumatic systems.

2. Software Engineering Department: Develops the software used to control the robot, along with supporting software for the team's operations.

3. Business Department: Provides real-world experience in non-profit fundraising, advertising, and managing the logistics of a large team.

4. Strategy Team: Comprised of members from all three departments, this team offers strategic assistance regarding robot design, gameplay, and alliance selections.

5. Media Team: Comprised of members from all three departments and led by the Business Department, this team handles all media-related matters such as videos, pictures, and promotional content.

6. Inspiration Team: Comprised of members from all three departments and led by the Business Department, this team is responsible for all matters related to the Inspiration Award, including presentation, essay, speech, outreach ideas, and video concepts.

We welcome individuals with diverse backgrounds and do not require prior experience in engineering, software engineering, business, strategy, media, or presenting. We are committed to teaching members the skills they need to participate effectively in FRC.

Membership on StuyPulse is unrestricted, and we do not discriminate based on race, gender, ethnicity, commitment to other clubs, grade, or any other factors. It is understood that students who enjoy the club will attend, and those who do not attend will not be considered members of the club.

## Charter Amendments:

The amendment process for the StuyPulse Robotics Charter will commence after the last competition of the school year. The meeting for charter amendments is open to all eligible members, with the requirement of having at least two-thirds of the Elected and Appointed Council present. Eligible members include those who have:

1. Paid their team dues,
2. Passed the safety test,
3. Written a reflection,
4. Met a specific percentage of attendance (decided by the Elected Council and faculty advisors).

In the days leading up to the meeting, a list of eligible members will be made public. Members wishing to propose charter amendments may submit their proposals to the team for initiating discussion. Amendments not proposed before the meeting may be discussed at the end of the meeting, provided there is extra time.

The team presidents will preside over the charter meeting and determine the order in which emailed proposals are addressed. For each proposal:

1. It must be read and seconded to move to an initial vote to gauge members' opinions.
2. If the vote is unanimous, no further discussion or second vote is needed.
3. If conflicting views arise, members will discuss their thoughts before the presidents call for a final vote. The majority will determine the outcome of the proposal.

If the faculty advisor identifies any issues with the charter, another meeting will be held to revise the problematic sections. The meeting's Moderator(s) will appoint a minutes taker, and the minutes will be made publicly available to all team members. The Elected Council for the next school year will promptly update the charter amendments before the next charter meeting.

## Elections:
Elections occur annually after the charter meeting to allow newly elected officials time to familiarize themselves with their positions and team management. After being elected, members will appoint members to the Appointed Council (AC). There is no term limit for any position, but candidates must run for election every year, regardless of opposition. A team member who will no longer be a Stuyvesant student the following year or is ineligible to vote cannot run for any elected position.

### Rules for Elections:
1. Elections start with an attendance call, after which no one may leave the room without permission and without submitting an absentee ballot (assuming they are eligible to vote).
2. Members with a certain attendance percentage who have paid team dues, passed the safety test, and written a reflection may attend and vote. The attendance percentage is decided by the Elected Council (EC) and faculty advisors. A list of eligible members must be made available before elections.
3. Absentee ballots must include the names of candidates for all positions for which the voter wants to cast a vote. If the voter does not choose a candidate for a position, they are abstaining from voting for that position.
4. One team member chosen by the Elected Council will serve as the Moderator, responsible for upholding rules, maintaining order, and mediating disputes.

### Order of Elections: 
Presidents of each department must be elected before Vice Presidents. The order of Vice Presidents may be the reverse order of Presidents, but it is at the Moderator's discretion.

### Election Process:
The following process will be followed for every position.

#### Nominations:
- The Presidents call for nominations for a position, and any team member may nominate another team member for that position. The nomination must be seconded.
- Self-nominations are not allowed.
- Nominees may decline the nomination.
- Members must send out a candidacy email prior to elections to run for an elected position.
- A person becoming a senior in the following year may not run for vice presidency.
- A person may run for any position absentee if approved by two current EC members. These two EC members' approval will serve as one nomination for the candidate, which must be seconded by someone other than the two EC members who approved the absentee candidate.

#### Candidate Presentations:
Each candidate has up to four minutes to present their qualifications for the position.

#### Discussion:
A discussion will be held for each position after the presentations. Candidates must leave the room during the discussion period.

#### Voting:
After the presentations, candidates leave the room, and voting commences. Voting for a department's candidate will be done by the department if it has 9 or more members; otherwise, the entire team will vote on that candidate.
- Ballots will be counted by the Moderator and one official mentor. Vote totals will not be made public.
- Submitted ballots may only be viewed by the Moderator and mentors. Members who intentionally view a ballot will lose their voting rights for the remainder of the elections.
- If no member is nominated for a position, the position becomes appointed.
- A “NONE” candidate is included in every election, including runoffs. If NONE wins, the position becomes appointed.
- In the event of a tie after runoffs, the position becomes appointed. Only the candidates who tied may be appointed to the position, unless they are elected or appointed to another position first.
- A member may abstain from voting during the election for any given position.
- If a candidate runs unopposed, the voting process will be expedited with a limited question and answer period.
- If more than two candidates run for a position, the following will occur:
  - Each department or team member casts one vote for a candidate. If a candidate receives a majority vote,

## Appointment: 
Appointed positions are determined by a majority vote of the elected officers after the conclusion of the election. The selected member may decline the appointment, in which case another member must be appointed.

If the elected officers cannot reach a majority vote, the appointment of that position will be delayed. Once all other positions are filled, the Elected Council (EC) and Appointed Council (AC) will vote on the appointed position again.

If any position remains unfilled by the EC/AC for any reason, the position will stay vacant.

AC positions can be held by any team member, regardless of their department affiliation.

An individual may hold only one (1) position on the team, whether on the EC or AC.

## Impeachment:
Members of the EC/AC, Impact Team, or drive team can be impeached for reasons that include, but are not limited to:
- Dereliction of duty
- Poor attendance (missing 4 or more of the last 10 meetings)
- Ignoring or disregarding the general will of the team
- Performing actions that are legally or morally detrimental to the team, such as:
  - Embezzlement
  - Disregard for safety
  - Intimidation of members
  - Misappropriation of team resources

Impeachment proceedings for EC/AC members are initiated through warnings given by a two-thirds majority of the EC/AC. The officer in question may defend themselves, and a two-thirds majority of the entire team must support the impeachment.

Any officers, unless suspended by the faculty advisor(s), may be reappointed at any time by a two-thirds majority vote of the Elected Members. If an EC/AC member is impeached or resigns, their position will be filled by a two-thirds majority vote of the remaining EC/AC. When the position of President of Engineering, President of Business, or President of Software Engineering is vacant, their respective Vice President may temporarily serve as President until the EC/AC elects another team member for the role.

Impeachment proceedings for Impact and drive team members are initiated through warnings given by those responsible for each team:

Responsible parties for the Impact Team include:
- EC
- Impact Team members

Responsible parties for the drive team include:
- EC
- Director of Strategy (DoS)
- Assistant Director of Strategy (ADoS)
